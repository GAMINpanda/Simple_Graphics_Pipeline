# Cursor Rules for Simple Graphics Pipeline Project

## Project Context
This is a Java 21 graphics project using LWJGL 3.3.3 and OpenGL for real-time rendering. The project follows professional development practices with branch protection, security scanning, and automated CI/CD.

## Code Style & Standards

### Java Conventions
- Use Java 21 features where appropriate (pattern matching, records, etc.)
- Follow conventional commit format: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `test:`, `chore:`, `ci:`
- Maintain 120 character line limit (Checkstyle enforced)
- Use meaningful variable names, especially for graphics concepts (vertices, shaders, buffers)
- Prefer composition over inheritance for graphics components

### Graphics-Specific Patterns
- Always check for OpenGL errors after GL calls in debug mode
- Use RAII pattern for OpenGL resources (create in constructor, cleanup in close/dispose)
- Prefer VBOs (Vertex Buffer Objects) over immediate mode rendering
- Use uniform buffer objects for frequently updated shader data
- Implement proper resource cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Handle LWJGL native memory explicitly with try-with-resources where possible

### LWJGL Best Practices
- Always call `glfwInit()` before any GLFW functions
- Check for GLFW and OpenGL initialization errors
- Use `MemoryStack` for temporary native memory allocation
- Prefer `BufferUtils` for persistent native buffers
- Use appropriate OpenGL version context (3.3 core profile minimum)

## Git Workflow

### Branch Management
- Use feature branches for new graphics features: `feature/add-lighting-system`
- Use fix branches for bugs: `fix/shader-compilation-error`
- Follow the branch protection rules and require PR reviews
- Use the git workflow script: `./scripts/git-workflow.sh feature <name>`
